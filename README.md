# CS 544: Introduction to Big Data Systems

**Course**: CS 544 - Introduction to Big Data Systems  
**Professor**: Tyler Caraza-Harter  
**University**: University of Wisconsin-Madison  
**Semester**: Fall 2024  

## Course Overview

This repository contains all 8 projects (P1-P8) from the CS 544 course, which covers fundamental concepts in big data systems including distributed computing, data processing frameworks, and cloud technologies.

## Projects

### P1: Counting Loans with Dockerized Shell Script (5% of grade)
**Description**: Setup programming environment with virtual machines and Docker. Write shell scripts to download and process loan data, then containerize the solution. Learn VM deployment, Docker installation, shell scripting, and containerization.

### P2: Counting Wins with gRPC and an LRU Cache (5% of grade)
**Description**: Build a distributed application using gRPC for communication between clients and servers. Implement hash-partitioned data access, LRU caching, and Docker Compose for multi-container deployment. Focus on distributed systems, gRPC, caching strategies, and container orchestration.

### P3: [Project Title Not Available]
**Description**: This project's README appears to be a template and doesn't contain specific project details.

### P4: HDFS Replication (6% of grade)
**Description**: Deploy and work with HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) cluster. Upload large files with different replication settings, use WebHDFS API, read files with PyArrow, and understand fault tolerance through data recovery when nodes fail. Learn HDFS architecture, replication strategies, and distributed file systems.

### P5: Spark, Loan Applications (5% of grade)
**Description**: Use Apache Spark to analyze loan applications data. Work with RDDs, DataFrames, and Spark SQL. Load data into Hive tables, optimize queries with bucketing and caching, and train Decision Tree models for loan approval prediction. Master Spark ecosystem, data warehousing, and machine learning with big data.

### P6: Cassandra, Weather Data (5% of grade)
**Description**: Build a gRPC server that receives weather data and stores it in Apache Cassandra. Implement Cassandra schemas with partition keys and cluster keys, use Spark for data preprocessing, and configure read/write availability tradeoffs. Learn NoSQL databases, distributed data storage, and consistency models.

### P7: Kafka, Weather Data (5% of grade)
**Description**: Implement Kafka producers and consumers for streaming weather data. Create topics, handle partition assignment, implement "exactly once" semantics, and build checkpointing for crash recovery. Master streaming data processing, message queues, and fault tolerance in distributed systems.

### P8: BigQuery, Loans Data (5% of grade)
**Description**: Work with Google Cloud Platform services including BigQuery and Google Cloud Storage. Combine data from multiple sources, query live Google Forms data, train linear regression models using BigQuery, and manipulate geographic data. Learn cloud data warehousing, SQL analytics, and geographic data processing.
